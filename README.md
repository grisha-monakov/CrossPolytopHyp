# CrossPolytopHyp

Numerical simulation for verifying the crosspolytop hypothesis

We are interested in verifying hypothesis, which is formulated in a following way: for arbitrary 2n points in S^n the volume of their convex hull is not greater than the volume of a crosspolytop, inscribed into the same sphere.
